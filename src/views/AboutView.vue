      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Hey! My name is Rory Hofland, I am an undergraduate student in my third
        year at the University of Toronto, and I am working my way towards a
        double major in Mathematics and Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        My appreciation for programming kicked off in high school, where I
        became familiar with Java and dabbled in C++. I was intrigued by the
        elegance and rigorousness of code, and by the usefulness of software.
        This introduction to computer programming greatly motivated me to
        further my knowledge and experience, so mathematical problem-solving
        became a core aspect of my working habits, which led me to pursue an
        education in STEM. Since then, I have added Python, HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and Node.js to my toolbelt, and I am constantly learning and
        looking for more skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than my academic studies, I have a few hobbies that occupy the
        rest of my time. I love to read, and will devour anything science
        fiction or high fantasy. I am currently reading "21 Lessons for the 21st
        Century" by Yuval Noah Harari. I also watch movies and enjoy dominating
        my family and friends at Settlers of Catan.

        I use this website to show off my projects and to share a little about
        myself for prospective employers. Make sure to check out my resume and
        projects pages for more information. Thanks for reading!
